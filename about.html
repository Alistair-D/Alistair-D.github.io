    <h2 id="aboutS"> About My Life:</h2>
    <p id="aboutLife">I was born in Janesville, Wisconsin. Although, my family is 
        originally South African! I am the first American in my bloodline, 
        supposedly!
    I attended St. Mary’s Elementary, St. Paul's, and  
    Craig High school (in that specific order).  
    I ‘ve traveled on trips all across America and Southern Africa.  
    As of writing this, I am 15 years old. However, that’ll change in January. <br> <br>
    My fascination with Science stemmed from my very first years. 
    I was first introduced to Science through Museums. 
    Natural History fascinates me the most, and it drives my curiosity. 
    Then, at St Mary’s, they began STEM robotics in my elementary years. 
   From what I remember, this was my first introduction to computer science. 
    I then moved into actual computer science classes at St. Paul’s. 
    I also started a career in fossil collecting/research. 
    Both of which have made me a lot more knowledgeable. 
    Now as a 9th grader (2025), 
    I have done both Computer Programming and Web Design.  
    I’ve proved my abilities in both!</p>

        <h2 id="aboutA"> About Athletics:</h2>
    <p id="abouta">About Athletics:
    I am a consistent Athlete (also a science lover) and I’ve 
    pursued myself through challenging runs like 400m, 800m, 1600m, 
    3200m, and the XC 5K.<br><br>
    My inspirations to run include Usain Bolt, Jakob Ingebrigtsen, 
    Yohan Blake, Tyson Gay, and the infamous Eliud Kipchoge. 
    All of which performed incomprehensible achievements. 
    I hope someday I can achieve feats as well. 
    Even if they’re just personal goals. </p>
